# Security Keys Brief
> My list of congrats and call-outs for services supporting (or not) security keys :key:

[I've just got myself a brand new Yubikey (5C)](https://twitter.com/GiladPeleg/status/1190239596392656897)
and wanted to write a brief summary of the level of support it has with services I use.

**Want to add a or change a service? PRs are greeted with happy emojis :trophy:**

## 10 thumbs up - the real deal :heart_eyes:

These services support multiple security keys alongside your other 2FA methods. They provide a great UX
and other services should take notice.

- Github
- Google
- Dropbox
- Facebook
- PyPi
- NameCheap

## Mediocre support :neutral_face:

These services support just 1 security key, sometimes interchangeably with other 2FA.

- Twitter
- AWS

## Lame support or no support :disappointed:

Support with [Yubikey Authenticator](https://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/download/yubico-authenticator/)
or no support at all :imp:

- LinkedIn
- eBay
- PayPal
- Amazon
- Mongo Cloud
